What is in the pipeline:

- Add command line option to configure the behaviour like
    - Refresh interval
    - Version
    - Whatever

- Instead of returning the value 0 when the NVML library errors, set an error
  value instead and print it accordingly in the UI.

- Add mouse and some keyboard shortcut for ncurses.

- Do a manpage
